        <p> Hello, my name is Andrew Reynolds. Most people I know call me andy, for short. I'm 23 years old, and I live in Mesa, Arizona. I joined the army when I was 18. I got to do a lot of cool things, see a lot of cool places and meet some really cool people. A good friend of mine whom I served with went to codeup in Texas and now he has a great career in the development industry ahead of him. That's how I discovered what a full stack developer was, and I took an interest in it as well.</p>

        <p>My goal is to land an entry level junior developer position somewhere in the industry when I graduate the Full Stack Development Program at SDGKU. I would like to specialize in python because artificial intelligence really interests me, and I would also like to learn android concepts because of the job market for it.</p>
